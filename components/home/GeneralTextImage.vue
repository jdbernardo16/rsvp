                            As we prepare to begin our forever together, we are
                            filled with joy at the thought of sharing this
                            special moment with you. Your love, support, and
                            presence in our lives have shaped who we are today,
                            and we cannot imagine celebrating without you by our
                            side. Join us as we exchange vows and create
                            memories that will last a lifetime.
